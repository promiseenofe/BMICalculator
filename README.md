# BMICalculator
A BMI Calculator that takes user input. This was one of the projects given to me during my introduction to software development provided by Amazon.

I wanted to add this project to my repositary and made some adjustments, In order for people to use this project for a healthier lifestyle that can influence their
diet habits or increase extra-ciricular activities(gym, running, sports etc...).

Feel free to make your own adjustments and improvements or use to your hearts content !
